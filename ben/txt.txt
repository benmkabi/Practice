Theme: Social Networks with Graphs

hey there i am Ben here.

The theme for the Mini Project is graph-based social networks.
A (far too) simple definition of a mathematical graph is “a set
of points together with lines joining certain pairs of these point”1.
This seemingly trivial idea can be used to describe and analyse many
real-world situations,includingsocialnetworks. With the points 
representing people and the lines joining pairs of friends. This

is precisely how today’s largest social networks work, albeit using more
 complexgraphs where linescan representmany differentrelationships, orinteractions
 such as follows and retweets. The task for this mini project is to solve a social
 network related problem using graph algorithms. Remember that there are many types
 of social networks - think LinkedIn, Pinterest and Tinder - and that your chosen network
 and problem do not have to be limited by what is already in existence. Be creative! Some
 examples of social graph related problems are:
